The submission consists in 4 main files.

- run.py - It is the script that generates the best prediction that we obtained on Kaggle. WARNING:
  16GB of RAM are advised to run this script.

- implementations.py - It contains all the 6 functions that we were supposed to implement. In
  addition we also added the regularized logistic regression with the Newton method and a lot of
  other utility functions that we used.

- project1_functions.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains an example of usage of all the 6
  functions we were supposed to implement. It allows also to compare the results of the different
  methods.

- project1_submission.ipynb - All the functions and scripts used for the Kaggle submission. It
  contains the function used for the cross validation and the script used to optimize the lambda
  parameter of the ridge regression.
